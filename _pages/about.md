# About me

This fall I'll be starting my PhD in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My previous work has been in preference modelling for multiagent systems, but who knows what the future holds :).

I earned my bachelor's degree at New College of Florida from 2015-2019.

I plan on porting stuff from my old website (sawyerwelden.com) over to here as well as posting about things I find interesting.
